# OMRON Z-15HS-B Mount
 This is a custom mounting bracket that I designed to install an OMRON Z-15HS-B microswitch on my Voron 2.4 equipped with Mandala Rose Works bed and kinematic mounts.  My mounts are installed in "reverse" orientation from the MRW standard in order to allow installation of the Nevermore filter under the bed - the single mount is therefore at the back of the bed instead of the front:

The bracket consists of three printed parts - the bracket itself, a small retainer to lock the Microfit connector in place and an optional terminal cover that I designed because I did not like the idea of having three electrically "live" M4 screws exposed in the chamber of the printer:

In addition, the assembly will require the following hardware:

- 2 M4x25 BHCS screws
- 2 M4 threaded brass inserts for 3D printed parts
- 3 M3x8 SHCS screws
- 3 captive nuts for 2020 extrusion

The assembly is pretty much self explanatory.  If you choose to use the terminal cover, the following photograph illustrates how to configure it:

The complete switch assembly ready to be installed onto the 2020 extrusion looks as follows:

Note: the height of the switch plunger has been located at approximately same height above the MRW 6 mm thick bed as the stock switch design is in relation to the stock bed.

To be continued...
